# react-spring-fullstack
The simplest example for a create-react-app frontend and a Spring Boot backend.

## Running backend
1. cd into RestfulService
2. Run the following command
```
mvn package && java -jar target/RestfulService-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Running frontend
1. cd into my-app
2. Run the following commands
```
sudo npm -g
npm start
```
Check out the releases I make as I gradually add features to it.
Happy hacking!
